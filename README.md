## About

```
Once you click the 'Start Quiz' button, you will be displayed a question with four multiple choice answers.
A timer will commence counting down from 70 seconds.
As you select your answer, you will move to the next question.
If you get a question correct, you will have 5 points added to your score.
If you get a question wrong, you will have 10 seconds deducted from your time. 
If your time reaches zero seconds before you answer all the questions, the quiz will end and you will be shown your score and have the chance to record your score.
Likewise, if you answer all the questions, you will be shown your score and have the chance to record your score.
